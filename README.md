# Scanning
For the scanning procedure we used the following sensoring:
1. the Polyga H3 3D scanner
2. the sony Î±7c mirroless digital camera

For digitizing the acquired data from the Polyga H3 3D scanner we used the accompanied software Flex3DScan and a rotary table as peripheral.

Each frescoe piece is scanned both from the bottom and and upper part, the bottom and upper parts are identified from the corresponding postfixes. For the bottom is `RPf_<id>a` and the upper `RPf_<id>b` respectively.
